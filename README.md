# Keras-Tuner
>Here, we are using Keras-tuner to find the optimal number of hidden layers and hidden Neurons in ANN 

> The Keras Tuner is a library that helps you pick the optimal set of hyperparameters for your TensorFlow program. The process of selecting the right set of hyperparameters for your machine learning (ML) or deep Learning (DL) application is called hyperparameter tuning or hypertuning.
